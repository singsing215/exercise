 
Dear Students,

 

Urgent Message to all Students

 

As the coronavirus outbreak gets worse and in view of the further shutdown of border crossings to Hong Kong, all students are urged to take note of the following arrangements:

 

1.

All non-local students currently in Mainland China and overseas should not come back to Hong Kong due to the following reasons:

 

(a)

To avoid the risk of exposure to virus during the journey to Hong Kong;

 

(b)

To avoid the need for quarantine on arrival in Hong Kong, bearing in mind the shortage of quarantine places;

 

(c)

As the development of the viral outbreak is unpredictable, it is possible that the suspension of on-campus face-to-face teaching and learning will be further extended to beyond the original due date of 2 March 2020, in which case taking the difficult journey to Hong Kong would not serve the intended purposes;

 

(d)

The university management is reviewing the situation on a daily basis and will make further announcements promptly on arrangements for teaching and learning for the rest of the semester. That would enable you to better plan your study-related travel. Until then, DO NOT travel to Hong Kong.  

 

2.

All students in Hong Kong who match our announced quarantine requirements, including Government quarantine for returnees from Hubei, as well as 14-day self- quarantine for symptom-free returnees from other parts of Mainland, are requested to comply fully with the quarantine arrangements.

 

3.

We appreciate the cooperation of students whose accommodation arrangements are impacted by quarantine arrangements.  It is essential for the University to protect the health of the whole student population at this difficult time. We will continue to stay in close touch with these students and meet their needs where practicable.

 

4.

All students currently in Hong Kong should not travel to the Mainland until the viral outbreak has been contained.

 

 

Roland T Chin
President
