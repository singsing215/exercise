ABSTRACT

China appears to offer a contradiction: On the one hand religious life is booming and we see the growth in the number of temples, especially Buddhist and Daoist. But at the same time we read of crackdowns on Islam in Xinjiang and Christian churches in the China heartland. Helping to explain these seemingly contradictory trends is a huge change in how the Chinese government approaches religion. For the first time in a century, the country is not run by a government not hostile to religion, but instead one that sees some religions as extremely helpful in governing the country--but is extremely skeptical toward other faiths. How this plays out is of more than casual interest. It will help determine China's future in the 21st century.
