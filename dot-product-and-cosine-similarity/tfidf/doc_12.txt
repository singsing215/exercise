To: All Science students

 

According to the email sent by the University on January 25, 2020 concerning the suspension of on-campus classes due to novel coronavirus pneumonia, we will switch to eLearning from January 31, 2020 - February 15, 2020, to replace the classroom teaching.

 

(1) eLearning (supported by Zoom or similar apps for real-time video lecture broadcasting) will be offered for all lectures, following your regular class timetable. You will be able to find the link in Moodle of your courses (or receive an email) to join Zoom;

 

(2) Experimental laboratory classes (wet lab), including SCIE1005 and final year projects offered by Biology, Chemistry, and Physics will be cancelled, and make-up laboratory classes will be arranged after.

 

If you encounter any problems as above mentioned, please approach your course instructors for assistance.

 

Thank you

 

Best regards,

Jianhua Zhang
