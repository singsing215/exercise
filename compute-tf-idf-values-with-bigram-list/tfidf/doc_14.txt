Dear Students and Colleagues, 
 
Thorough campus cleaning to combat the novel coronavirus pneumonia
 
The University has stepped up environmental hygiene measures on campus against the novel coronavirus pneumonia, including the implementation of enhanced cleaning and disinfection schedule.  In addition to increased frequency of cleaning for classrooms, lifts, washrooms, lobbies etc., thorough campus cleaning and disinfection will be carried out from 29 January 2020 (Wednesday) to 7 February 2020 (Friday) to cover all walls and floors of circulation areas within the campus.  
 
A designated webpage on the novel coronavirus pneumonia has been set up at http://ehsu.hkbu.edu.hk/2019-nCOV/ containing  the University’s announcements and the Government’s health information related to the disease.  Students and staff are encouraged to visit the webpage regularly during the Chinese New Year holidays to keep abreast of the latest developments and measures taken by the University and the Government to battle this potential epidemic.
 
Please stay alert and pay attention to your personal hygiene during the holidays, and wish you all a Healthy and Happy Chinese New Year.
