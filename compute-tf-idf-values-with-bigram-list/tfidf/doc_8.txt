Dear students and colleagues,

 

Infection control on campus

 

A student who briefly stopped over in Wuhan on 21 January while in transit has recently returned to the University campus. We immediately sought official advice from the Department of Health and advised the student to fulfil the 14-day self-quarantine requirement, which ended on 4 February. The room in which the student was staying has been disinfected as a precautionary measure, and up-to-date health advice has also been given to the student.

 

Based on our records, two colleagues and two other students returned to Hong Kong from Hubei and reported to the Department of Health. They are now under home quarantine.  

 

With an increasing number of infections from the new coronavirus both locally and abroad, we are all concerned about the health of our fellow students and colleagues. We have also implemented strict infection control on campus to help reduce the spread of the virus. If you come across members of the University who need assistance in this regard, please let us know or call the campus health and safety hotline on 3411 7997.

 

Stringent preventive measures have been implemented at campus entrances. These include temperature checks, compulsory online health declarations, and mandatory ID card checks. Access to the campus will be denied if students or members of staff:

 

•

Have not completed the online health declaration [HERE]; or

•

Have travelled to mainland China in the past 14 days; or

•

Have a fever, cough, diarrhoea, vomiting or flu-like symptoms; or

•

Have been in close contact with anyone diagnosed with or suspected of any respiratory disease.

 

In addition, we urge all of you to note the following:

 

•

The health declaration will need to be resubmitted should there be any changes in the viral outbreak;

•

All students are urged NOT to return to the campus until on-campus classes resume; and

•

All students and colleagues who are now in Hong Kong should refrain from travelling to the Mainland. If you have recently travelled to the Mainland, you are required to self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. Please consult a doctor immediately if you develop a fever or other respiratory infection symptoms.

 

Your attention and compliance with these measures is essential and will help the University manage the novel coronavirus outbreak. Please stay alert of the latest developments and find updates on HKBU’s Bulletin Board (http://ehsu.hkbu.edu.hk/2019-nCOV/) and the Government website (www.gov.hk).

 

Best regards and stay healthy,

 

Roland T Chin

President
